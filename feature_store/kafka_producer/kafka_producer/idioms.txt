A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A penny for your thoughts
A penny saved is a penny earned
A perfect storm
A picture is worth 1000 words
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
Barking up the wrong tree
Birds of a feather flock together
Bite off more than you can chew
Break the ice
By the skin of your teeth
Comparing apples to oranges
Costs an arm and a leg
Do something at the drop of a hat
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't cry over spilt milk
Don't give up your day job
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Every cloud has a silver lining
Get a taste of your own medicine
Give someone the cold shoulder
Go on a wild goose chase
Good things come to those who wait
He has bigger fish to fry
He's a chip off the old block
Hit the nail on the head
Ignorance is bliss
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
