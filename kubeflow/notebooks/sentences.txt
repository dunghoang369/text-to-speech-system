A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way.
Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.
To live is to fight.
Live each day as if it’s your last.
Work hard, dream big.
Defeat is simply a signal to press onward.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
A winner never stops trying.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you can’t see a shadow.
Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.
If today were the last day of your life, would you want to do what you are about to do today?
Every new day is another chance to change your life.
Peace does not mean one where no noise, no trouble, and no toil. When we are in a storm, we still feel the calm of mind. That is the real meaning of peace!
Stars can’t shine without darkness.
You should learn from your competitor but never copy. Copy and you die.
Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.
Just be yourself, because life’s too short to be anybody else.
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game!
